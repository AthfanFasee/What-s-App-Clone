WhatsApp Clone

A serverless chat app with live chat updates and server-side rendering(SSR). This means when entering someone's chat the chats will be already available there instead of client-side rendering which makes the app so smooth. I have used firebase as my cloud BaaS and firebase google authentication as a way for users to sign in. And used Material UI in required places to make the front-end look Solid. And finally, this app is fully test written. This app is a clone of only the desktop version of WhatsApp, so no responsive added to it.
I will be keep adding stuffs to this project.


Tools Used  :  JavaScript,  React,  NextJS(12),  FireBase(9),  MUI,  Styled-Components,  Jest
